### Meyer May House Docent
In Grand Rapids, we are lucky enough to have an incredible Frank Lloyd Wright house which has been restored by Steelcase. My responsibilities here are to lead tours and be a subject-matter expert for patrons with questions. In my unique tour, I provide carefully researched information regarding motifs throughout Mr. Wright's work here along with interesting parallels and connections to work elsewhere in the world.
