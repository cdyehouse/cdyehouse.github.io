### Books: The Windows to the World
My first experience sharing my love of books with others began in college when I worked at the school bookstore and was able to see directly the positive impact my work had on the customers. Now, I have come full circle in my work with the Hastings Public Library where my passion for learning and sharing knowledge is well-utilized. I am responsible for assisting patrons, aesthetic improvements, administrative assistance, and library organization.
